# Bot setup guide

Please look at section [**Hosting the bot**](#hosting-the-bot) first, and decide which plan you would like. If you want me to host the bot for you, you only have to do sections [**Creating the bot account**](#creating-the-bot-account) and [**Configuration**](#configuration), and provide me details such as the bot token that needs to be filled into `config.json`.

## Creating the bot account

1. Go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Login to your discord account
3. Click on `New Application`
4. Enter the name of your bot and press create
5. Click on the `Bot` tab on the left menu bar
6. Click on `Add Bot`
7. Scroll down and enable `PRESENCE INTENT` and `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`, then press `Save Changes`
8. Press `OAuth2` on the left menu bar
9. Also select admin in bot permissions to give the bot the permissions it needs
10. Check the `bot` checkbox and press `Copy`
11. You can paste this link in your browser and add this bot to any discord server you want. You can use this link again to add the bot into other servers!

## Setting up the files

1. You should have git pre-installed if you are using mac or linux. If not, download and install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Go to the github page of this repo and press `â¬‡Code`, select `HTTPS`, then copy the link
3. Start a terminal
4. Use the `cd` command to navigate to wherever you want the bot files to be placed in
5. Type `git clone [paste in the link here]` (add sudo if you are on linux and it gives you an error)
6. Login to your github account in the terminal
7. Navigate to the folder that contains the bot's code in a file explorer
8. Rename all files ending with `.json.example` to `.json`, removing the `.example`, such as renaming `config.json.example` to `config.json`

## Configuration

### Getting the bot token

1. Click on the `Bot` tab on the left menu bar
2. Click on `Copy` under `TOKEN`. Remember, never give this token to strangers, as they can gain full access to your bot if they gain access to this token!
3. Fill in the token into config.json

   Here is an example:

   ```
   ...
   "TOKEN": "ODE4NDY3Mzc0NzE3OTkzMDAx.YEYfJA.j_vM2raH-LOsGDcZGavrBjqk9hk",

## Hosting the bot

You have 3 options:

A. Host it locally on your computer (which needs to be on 24/7)

B. Rent a VPS yourself.

C. Pay $10 a month for me to host the bot for you.

For options A and B, you can pay a one-time $20 for me to help you set it up on your computer/server
For option C, the $20 setup fee is not optional.

You will have to do the config steps above yourself anyways, since there is no way for me to access your accounts to do them for you. If you chose step A, or if you have a VPS and would like to do the setup yourself, proceed:

1. Go to the [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download and install NodeJs on your computer/server
3. Start a command prompt/terminal
4. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder that cointains the bot's code
5. Type `npm install` in the terminal and then press enter
6. Type `node .` in the terminal to run the bot! Press `ctrl + c` to stop the bot.

<!--
## After hosting the bot

1. Go to your wordpress dashboard > WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Webhooks
2. Copy the payload URL in the logs
3. Click on `Add Webhook`
4. Fill in the Name, set the status to Active, set the topic to Order created, and then paste the payload URL under `Delivery URL`
5. Press save webhook
